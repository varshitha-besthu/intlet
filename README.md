#  Intlet ‚Äî AI-Powered Plan Executor for VS Code

**Intlet** is a VS Code extension inspired by _Traycer_, designed to help developers generate, visualize, and execute multi-phase coding plans using **Google Gemini**.

It takes a natural language query (like _"Add a dark mode toggle and commit changes"_) and breaks it into structured, executable phases ‚Äî shell commands, git commits, file edits, and more.
